# Semester Android Project: News App

### Project Overview

The objective is to develop a News Feed app that provides users with regularly updated news sourced from the internet, focusing on a specific topic, person, or location. For this project, the [Guardian API](http://open-platform.theguardian.com/documentation/) will be utilizedâ€”an API known for its robustness and JSON-formatted data.

### API Key Instructions

Ensure to insert your API key for proper functionality. Navigate to the `Constants.java` file within the utils directory and locate the API_KEY value. Replace "test" with your personal API key as follows:
```java
public static final String API_KEY = "YOUR-API-KEY";
```
